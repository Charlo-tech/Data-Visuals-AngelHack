# Data-Visuals-AngelHack

This is a data visualisation web app built using python and streamlit.
The data is sourced from Kaggle over a period of years from 2011 to 2023.
Data science packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib and plotly have been used to make all this possible.

A live version of the deployed web app can be found here.
