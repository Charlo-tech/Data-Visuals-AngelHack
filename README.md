# UniRank Explorer Data visuals AngelHack

This is a data visualisation web app built using python and streamlit.
The data is sourced from Kaggle over a period of years from 2011 to 2023.
Data science packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib and plotly have been used to make all this possible.

A live version of the deployed web app can be found [here](https://charlo-tech-data-visuals-angelhack-main-l2kag3.streamlit.app/).
We also made a Tableau visualization for data according to countries [here](https://public.tableau.com/shared/THKKNQJ9G?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

# The Data Story
UniRank seeks to visualize campus data to help aspiring students choose the best institutions to further their studies. With data 
collected over 13 years from 2011, UniRank shows what universities have maintained the top position over the years. We also checked for
accredited universities and for closed universities. The story tells of areas with the largest number of universities all the way to the smallest.

# Thought Process
We considered jupyter notebooks for the visualization but we wanted the portability of a web app, and so we settled on Streamlit as it allows us to set up everything however we want and need it to be. We focused on a few study areas as the dataset was quite large and we would like to continue with the analysis post submission.
